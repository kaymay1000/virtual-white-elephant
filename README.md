# Virtual White Elephant

## Please note: This project is currently in progress!

Don't get stuck with those ugly socks (nobody wants your re-gift, Karen!), or that mystery-flavored jam that's at _least_ a decade old... let Virtual White Elephant handle the logistics of hosting a virtual gift exchange, so all you have to do is kick back, relax, and watch your foolproof gift-swapping strategy unfold.

## Why I created Virtual White Elephant (VWE)

This project was born out of the C\*vid-19 pandemic. Something I love to do around the holidays, as do many folks, is participate in a gift exchange with friends or family. Enter: C19. Fear, frustration, plans derailed left and right... including holiday celebrations and traditions. 

This is what sparked the idea for VWE. I wanted to come up with a way for friends/families to manage the logistics of a gift exchange held over Zoom, with the hope that it would help restore a tiny bit of normalcy to an utterly abnormal chapter of human history.

## For Developers

### Stack

- React (w/ TypeScript)
- Yarn
- Eventually MERN (see planned features below)

### Current Features

- Cohesively styled, fully responsive web app (using Tailwind and HeadlessUI).
- Ability to add player names.
- Maintains fairness by randomly assigning the order in which players will open a gift.
- Keeps track of how many unopened gifts remain.
- Ability to update a gift's current owner (please note: this feature still needs some logic improvements).

### Planned Features

- Ensure accessibility/A11Y compliance.
- Make game details session persistent.
- Keep track of (and display to the user) how many times a gift has been stolen (max of 3 times, then it's "frozen").
- Implement Redux to (hopefully) reduce excessive amounts of lifted state and prop drilling, particularly for the Exchange page and all of its child components.
- Ability to email a formatted list of the exchange results to whoever would like a copy.
- Eventually want to stand up some sort of simple backend for storing game data.
- Potentially refactor/rewrite this project in React Native or Swift with the hope of publishing it to an app store or two.

### Running the project

- This is a create-react-app project that currently does not have a backend, so booting it up is quite simple.
- After cloning this repo, run `yarn install` in your terminal to install all necessary dependencies.
- Run `yarn start` to boot the app.
- Visit `localhost:3000/` in your browser and get started!

## Gameplay

- Designate one player to be the Host.
- Each player places their gift in view of their webcam.
- Each player "draws" a number at random.
- Player #1 chooses which gift they'd like to "open", and has the player who brought that gift unveil it on camera for all to see.
- Player #2 has two options: choose another gift to open, or steal player #1's gift.
- If your gift is stolen, you may either choose a new gift to open or steal another gift.
- A gift can only be stolen twice after its initial opening-- after two steals, the gift becomes "frozen" and remains with its third/final owner.
- Gameplay continues sequentially until each player has gotten a chance to either open a new gift, or steal an existing one.

VWE was designed and written by me, Kaylee Alvarado.
