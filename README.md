# Virtual White Elephant

Don't get stuck with those ugly socks (nobody wants your re-gift, Karen!), or that mystery-flavored jam that's at _least_ a decade old... let Virtual White Elephant handle the logistics of hosting a virtual gift exchange, so all you have to do is kick back, relax, and watch your foolproof gift-swapping strategy unfold.

## Gameplay

- Designate one participant to be the Host
- Each Participant places their gift in view of their webcam
- Each Participant "draws" a number at random
- Participant #1 chooses which gift they'd like to "open", and has the Participant who brought that gift unveil it on camera for all to see
- Participant #2 has two options: choose another gift to open, or steal Participant #1's gift
- If your gift is stolen, you may either choose a new gift to open or steal another gift
- A gift can only be stolen twice after its initial opening-- after two steals, the gift "dies" and remains with its third/final owner
- Gameplay continues sequentially until each Participant has gotten a chance to either open a new gift, or steal an existing one

## Using VWE (tips for the Host)

- Make sure you provide VWE with an accurate Participant count (be sure to include yourself if applicable!)
